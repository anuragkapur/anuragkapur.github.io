* Identify requirements and use-cases; both functional and non-functional
  * Request latency / performance
  * Availability
  * Scalability (scheduled, handling spikes/bursts)
  * Consistency (if applicable to the use-case)
  * Fault-tolerance (including disaster recovery and logic bugs / human errors)
* Back of the envelope calculations
* Logical architecture
* Deployment architecture (technology choices, taking non-functional requirements into perspective)
* Validate if requirements are met
* Identify shortcomings / limitations
