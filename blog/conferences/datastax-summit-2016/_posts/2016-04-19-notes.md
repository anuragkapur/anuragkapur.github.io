## Making Connections With Graphs

* Relations DBs, joins, filtering, normal forms
* Relational db - schema changes as your use cases evolve become painful
    * Every entity gets a table
    * Lots of many to many tables
    * Rigid structure
    * Going from one to many requires a migration and new data model
* Solving problems with graph
    * Fundamentals
        * Vertex - a thing, example: Movie, Person
        * Edges - labeled, directional relationships
        
        JCVD -- acted in --> Time cop
             -- acted in --> Blood sport
             -- directed --> Blood sport

    * Properties - similar to fields in a table             
    * Power of graphs are relationships
    * Summary

    * Tinkerpop 3 & Gremlin - API for graph query
    
        g.V().has("person", "name", "JCVD")
              
* RDF stores vs Graph DBs
    * RDF - great for inferencing capabilities, but tend to not scale very well
    * RDF stores can be considered to be specialist graph DBs
