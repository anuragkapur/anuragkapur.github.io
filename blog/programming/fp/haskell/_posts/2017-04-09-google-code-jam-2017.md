After having to skip participation last year, I was very close to having skip again this year due to time sensitive 
commitments. I knew, I would not be able to compete in Round 1, post the qualification round this year. Nevertheless, 
participated in the qualification round, which, as always, was fun!

Here is the 2017, QR dashboard with problem statements: [https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard)

I scored the bare minimum qualification threshold of 25 points, after a silly mistake cost me 15 additional points, which
was a little disappointing. Being rusty with competitive programming didn't help.

Here is the code I wrote to solve the 3 problems I attempted: [https://github.com/anuragkapur/google-code-jam/tree/master/src/main/java/com/anuragkapur/gcj2017/qr](https://github.com/anuragkapur/google-code-jam/tree/master/src/main/java/com/anuragkapur/gcj2017/qr)
