# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for the SWE
by Rob Harrop

* ML is becoming a competitive necessity
* ML is *what's next* for software engineers
* DevOps, uS, containers etc concentration on "how", ML is about the "what"
* ML still needs good SWE practices - iterations, version control, testing etc
* ML and DevSecOps people need to work together and pull in the same direction
* Skill generalisation vs specialisation
    - Individuals specialise, teams generalise
* To learn ML, you don't need to "first" learn all the theory
    - Learning theory after practicing and intuition is easier than learning theory first
* Recommended books
    - (No. 1 recommendation) Doing Data Science, Cathy O'Neil & Rachel Schutt
    - Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
* Learning resources
    - Coursera Data Science Specialisation - Brian Caffo and Roger Peng
    - (Speaker's favourite) Coursera Deep Learning Specialisation - Andrew Ng
    - MIT OCW Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang
    - Coursera Calculus One and Two
* Kaggle - real problem sets to learn ML with
* Beware of bias
    - "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" - Charles Goodhart
    - Data bias
    - Learned bias

# Guardians of the Galaxy - Architecting a Culture of Secure Software
by Laura Bell

* Security journey    
absent -> ad-hoc -> gated -> agile -> continuous
* Good practices to be meet security objectives    
    - Automation of deployment, provisioning, static analysis, vulnerability management etc
    - Autonomy - builder of system is best placed to fix security problems in the system; every person in every SWE 
    team needs the skills, authority and accountability for security
    - Integrated into pipeline - has a cost; use dependency checkers, static analysis tools, vulnerability scanners etc
        * ensure there is alert noise to keep this effective
    - Measurable
    - Respectful - every action has a cost, value the time and resource needed to complete an action
* Culture
    - Extend blameless culture to security
    - Data driven security - patch adoption, upgrade rates, device patterns, browser patterns, error rates,
    query times etc
        * Some of these are not security metrics, but that's ok, it doesn't have to be

# Insecure Transit - Microservice Security
by Sam Newman

* Data breach investigation report by Verizon - yearly publication
    - 81% of all data breaches are because of bad passwords (stolen or weak)
* Good advise on passwords and management of passwords
    - Refer to article by Troy Hunt
    - Longer is stronger
    - Eliminate complex character composition rules
    - Embrace password managers - not just for personal use, *but also for your day job!*
    - Do not mandate password changes, instead monitor for password compromises (How?)
    - Check for breached passwords - Troy Hunt's pwned service
* Three R's of enterprise security
    - Rotate: short-lived credentials
    - Repave: patch your stuff
    - Repair: if you are not sure, burn it down! Easy with IaaS, repeatable infra and application provisioning
* **Test your production back-ups**
* Where are your back-ups? Back-up of data stored in a AWS account, stored in the same AWS account? What if an attacker
gets access to your AWS credentials and nukes your DB **and** the back-ups
* Make use of secret stores, example: Hashicorp Vault, AWS Key Management Service
* 44% of data breaches occur due to lack of patching (Source: Forbes), example: Equifax breach due to lack of patching 
of a vulnerability in version of Struts being used
* Patch hygiene is important - patch cycles have gone down, make sure you keep up
![patching-is-important](/assets/blog/training/qcon/patching.png)
* Understand and implement authN and authZ
    - Can use OAuth, JWT etc for authZ

# Microservices & Scaling of Rational Interactions
* uS may be lost into obscurity in a few years, not because they will be obsolete, but because they will be second 
nature and hidden under higher levels of abstraction
* Languages will start taking care of distributed scaling and similar properties of uS
* Promise theory
    - Adhering to the public API spec
    - An agent can only promise its own behaviours
    - Imposition on others is likely ineffective without a promise to accept
    - Both receiver and agents have to promise for effect
    - Every agent assesses others' promise from its own perspective
    - Dependency on another agent's promise may make a promised ineffective
* Services make promises, how they are deployed - as a uS or a monolith, doesn't affect how an outsider views the 
promises
* Modularity - good for performance? good for aesthetics? good for cognitive thinking?
* Monitoring isn't evolving at the same pace of modularity
    - Monitoring and debugging in a highly modular ecosystem is complicated
        
# Rust 2018 - an epoch release
* Systems programming language, fast, prevents seg faults, guarantees thread safety
* Low level (pointers, mem allocation) and high level stuff can be done
    - program an OS
    - write command line tools
    
# Java at Speed
* Code goes through stages in the JVM Interpreted -> Tier 1 profiling -> optimised
* Java code is slow to start with and gets faster over time
* JIT compilers know what machine they are running on and thus translate to different machine codes for the same java 
code
* JMH - tool for uBenchmarking

# Continuous Delivery of Microservices
by Sheroy Marker

* CD - release **quickly** and in a sustainable way
* Challenges
    - Maintaining integrity of complex distributed systems
    - Safely and rapidly releasing features constantly
    - Managing deployments od disparate technology stacks
* Considerations
    - Test strategy
    ![test-strategy](/assets/blog/training/qcon/IMG_2712.png)
    - CI
        * Trunk based development - essential to have tests first for this to work, else you might end up having 
        untested code in trunk and thus trunk wouldn't be releasable. Trunk should always be releasable.
        * Feature toggles - should be short lived and should be discarded once feature has been released to prod. These
        are tech debt requiring if-else branches. This needs to be cleaned-up on a regular basis.
    ![ci](/assets/blog/training/qcon/IMG_2714.png)    
    - Environments - right number and types
        * Plan intended use for environments
        * Dynamic environment creation
    - Managing configuration
        * Manage configurations centrally instead of having them spread across chef, code repo, CD tool etc
        * Governance process for secrets
    - Remediation
        * When a pipeline breaks - rollback or roll forward? If quick, roll forward else rollback. Rollbacks are tricky.
        * Try maintaining backwards compatibility, esp with DB changes
        
# Is Boilerplate Code Really So Bad?
by Trisha Gee

* TL;DR - YES!
* Boilerplate can obscure business logic
* Being expressive is better than being terse
* Unnecessary syntax
    - semicolons
    - new keyword
    - anything whose only purpose is to tell the computer what to do and doesn't contribute towards functionality
* JShell for rapid prototyping and feedback
* Java has moved on in the last 3 years
![java-version-evolution](/assets/blog/training/qcon/IMG_2716.png)
* IDE generates boilerplate, but when you come back to it you can't identify auto generated vs custom code
    - Code generation is useful but not really the answer
* Kotlin removes a lot of boilerplate, like Java 10, Scala etc
* Java 8 optionals - more readable
* Kotlin: Expressing the lambda definition in the signature of the method
