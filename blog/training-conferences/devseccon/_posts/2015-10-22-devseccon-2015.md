# Securing innovation @ speed and scale via DevSecOps

* Devops growing faster than security - problem!
* Cloud security is on the rise
    * security has to keep up with innovation pace of other engineering features
* Get out of checklist mode; automate security testing
* Problems
    * friction for the sake of it
    * manual process and meeting culture
    * point in time assessments
    * thought about outside the value creation process
* Mission - "Target customer value through secure iterative innovation at speed and scale"
* Red and blue team security testing - "find exploits day"
* Security self service is important
* Devsecops
    * Security engineering 
        * experiment, automate, test
    * Ops
        * hunt, detect, contain
    * Compliance operations
        * response manage and train
    * Security science
        * learn, measure, forecast
* Make it simple
    * reduce size of blast radios
        * smaller teams, services, failures, APIs

# Transforming security from qualitative to quantitative

http://www.slideshare.net/sc0ttruss/chefdevseccon2015

* Quantitative - can be coded, automated etc
* Qualitative - just blah blah blah
* Security as code is the key - it has to be quantitative
* Security happens in tiers
    * Trim down the OS - remove what you don’t need
    * At check-in to source control
    * Running of orchestration jobs
    * etc
* Security tests are needed at all steps of the pipeline, not just at the running prod node

* 1 global firewall to 100s of virtual firewalls

# Continuous Security Testing

Speaker: http://www.slideshare.net/StephendeVries2
Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/StephendeVries2/continuous-security-testing-devseccon

* Traditionally - security testing happens after the product is built, via external experts
* Security testing is where quality testing was 10 years ago
* Automation tools
    * https://github.com/continuumsecurity/bdd-security
    * Selenium + OWASP ZAP (HTTP/S Proxy)
* False positives from automation tools are important to remove
* Security test ownership
    * Separate security team - nah
    * DevOps team owned, with consultancy from security team - maybe
    * DevOps + Sec team; one cross-skilled team - yeah
* Manual security tests are still needed; but once a vulnerability is found via a manual test, feed it back to the automated txt suite
* More tools
    * Mittn
    * ZAP-Junit
    * OWASP ZAP Jenkins plugin
    * Gauntlet (gauntlt.org)
    
# Making the Web Secure by Design with OWASP-SKF
    
## Security Knowledge Framework
 
* OWASP ASVS checklist - application security verification standard, since 2011
    - levels 1-3
* Training
    - OWASP security knowledge framework
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Knowledge_Framework

# Securing your infrastructure one unit test at a time

* Devops - infrastructure as code
    * definitive
    * versionable
    * reviewable
    * shareable
* Reiteration of BDD-Security framework and its usefulness
* Github - search for “gitrob"
* Next time you have a security issue, write a test
    * make it go green
    * keep it running all the time
    
# The Tao of security science
    
* Security science
    * F.U.D to facts
    * What is your password policy?
    * How frequently do you need to patch?
    * Min length of password vs algorithm
* Promoting security
    * Scoring/grades are powerful motivators
        
# Securing your assets through devops delivery
        
* Devops and CD principles
* OWASP OpenSAMM (maturity model)
* Security patterns exist - where?
* What about your assets?
    * git / your code
    * CD server
* Attackers circumvent, not break
* How to secure your assets
    * obfuscation - really??!! 
    * encryption of code in transit
    * audit your code footprint
            
# An end to cargo cult security

* Automated vulnerability scans not enough. Manual pen tests are needed
* Can you detect a planned vulnerability scan from your monitoring tools / logs

# Whats not to like?

* Make your OS image part of your build
    * patching as a separate process disappears
* Only use immutable and young servers
* Don’t let anyone log onto production
    * always go via your CD and log monitoring tools etc
    * there will be exceptions, which is pl

# Chain Reactions

* ~ 90% functionality comes from dependencies
    * what about security testing of your dependencies?
