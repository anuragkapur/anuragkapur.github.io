# anuragkapur.github.io

## What is this?
My github.io website. I use this space to
* write blog posts / articles
* capture study, conference, reading notes on a variety of topics
* link to content from other sources, so that this site can act as a central table of contents

##Â Using categories for posts

### Special categories

* highlight - show on homepage
* blog - every post should have this category. Don't have a good use for this
at the moment but I suspect it will come in handy at some point ;)
