# General principles<sup>1</sup>
* Leave the campground cleaner than you found it       
"If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot. The cleanup 
doesn’t have to be something big. Change one variable name for the better, break up one function that’s a little too 
large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one composite if statement."

# Meaningful names<sup>1</sup>
* Use Intention-Revealing Names
* Avoid disinformation    
"Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it’s actually a List"
* 



# Prefer functional style over imperative

# Prefer composition over inheritance
