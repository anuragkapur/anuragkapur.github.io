## Making Connections With Graphs

* Relations DBs, joins, filtering, normal forms
* Relational db - schema changes as your use cases evolve become painful
    * Every entity gets a table
    * Lots of many to many tables
    * Rigid structure
    * Going from one to many requires a migration and new data model
* Solving problems with graph
    * Fundamentals
        * Vertex - a thing, example: Movie, Person
        * Edges - labeled, directional relationships
        
        JCVD -- acted in --> Time cop
             -- acted in --> Blood sport
             -- directed --> Blood sport

    * Properties - similar to fields in a table             
    * Power of graphs are relationships
    * Summary    
    ![Graph fundamentals summary](/img/content/datastax-summit-2016/datastax-summit-dse-summary.png)
        
    * Tinkerpop 3 & Gremlin - API for graph query
    
        g.V().has("person", "name", "JCVD")
              
* RDF stores vs Graph DBs
    * RDF - great for inferencing capabilities, but tend to not scale very well
    * RDF stores can be considered to be specialist graph DBs

## Data modelling
  
* Write path
    
        Data -> Memtable -> Commit log -> SSTable
    
* SSTable compaction
    * Compaction strategies
        * Size tiered
        * Leveled
        * Date tiered (sort of not recommended - use with care)
        * Time tiered (not available yet, may come)
        
* Data organisation
    * Partition key
    * Clustering key
    * Columns
    * Primary key = partition + clustering key
    
* Data modelling
    * Always include partition key in where clause of query
        * User login scenario - customer login by email

    ![Login scenario - Solution](/img/content/datastax-summit-2016/datastax-summit-login-problem-solution.png)
        
    * User defined types and collections
    
    ![User defined types](/img/content/datastax-summit-2016/datatstax-summit-dse-user-defined-types.png)
   
    * Avoid client side joins from 2 or more tables
    * Customer registration problem
        * If an insert is done by 2 different clients at around the same time, the last write wins. This may be a 
        problem in certain use-cases. Example: user registration by email
        * Solution ![User registration problem solution](/img/content/datastax-summit-2016/datatstax-summit-customer-registration-problem-solution.png)
        * IF NOT EXISTS - expensive, use with caution, when really required
    * Customer login problems
        * Customers, Customers_by_email
        * Materialized view w/ DSE 5.0
