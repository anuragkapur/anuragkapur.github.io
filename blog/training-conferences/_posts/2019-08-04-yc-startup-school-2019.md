# How to Evaluate Startup Ideas
* Startup idea = Problem, Solution, Insight
  - Insight is - why do you think your solution to the problem while make your business successful
* Good problems  
  - Popular: lots of people have these problems; Ideal: 1M+
  - Growing: more and more will have this problem in the future; Ideal: 20% yoy growth
  - Urgent: need to be solved very quickly; Ideal: right now
  - Expensive: expensive to solve; Ideal: millions of $
  - Mandatory: people have this problem and they have to solve it: Ideal: law changed
  - Frequent: people are going to encounter these problems over and over again: Ideal: hourly or multiple times a day
* A good startup idea = atleast 1 if not a few characteristics of a good problem are met
* Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Trigger
* Solution: don't start here!
  - SISP: Solution In Search of a Problem = bad
* Insight = unfair advantages / why will you win and others will lose
  - Founders: Are you special? Engineer at Google, PM at Google etc != special. Specific patent in a specific field of 
  Biotech = special
  - Market: is your market growing explosively such that if you build a product in this market, you will automatically
  grow? This advantage alone, is usually a week in eyes of investors
  - Product: is your product 10x better than others example: faster, cheaper etc?
  - Acquisition: can you acquire users without paid marketing? Ideal: $0 to acquire new users
  - Monopoly: as your company grows does it become harder for competitors to defeat you? Example: companies with 
  network effect or marketplaces tend to exhibit this characteristic
